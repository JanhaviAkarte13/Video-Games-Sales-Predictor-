## 💡 Project Overview
This project addresses a **business need in the video game industry**: estimating a product's market potential.  

We built a predictive tool that uses **historical sales data** to forecast a game's performance based on its characteristics (name, genre, platform, etc.).  

- Backend: **Flask** for data processing and model predictions.  
- Frontend: Custom interface to make predictions easily accessible.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
We implemented multiple ML models to ensure robust forecasting:

- **Linear Regression** → baseline model  
- **Random Forest** → ensemble model for better accuracy  

Using multiple models allows us to **compare results** and improve confidence in predictions.
